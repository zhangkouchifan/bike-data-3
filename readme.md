## by Fanlaizhangkou24/7


## Dataset

> This investigation uses the Ford GoBike System Data of 2020 Apr used during this exploration is published on https://www.lyft.com/. It includes ids of bike rides, the start - end time/geographic information, the member and rideable bike types. For my exploration , I removed the geographic information, changed the date information from timespam to date type and added new columns for starting hour and starting day of week.


## Summary of Findings

> During this exploration I found that the amount of users prefer electric bikes are about twice as much as the amount of users prefer docked bikes, especially on weekdays. However, on weekends, docked bike get more popular than they normally are on weekdays. The busy hours for weekdays and weekend are also slightly different. Although electric bikes get used more frequently, the average riding time for docked bike is still much longer than electric bikes perhaps because they are much slower.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In this investigation I mainly focused on how bike usage differ when the user type, bike type and starting time change. I decided to combine the the bivariate charts so they could be compared side by side and observed more easily.
